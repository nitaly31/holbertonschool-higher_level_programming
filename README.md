# :rocket: Higher Level Programming

Repository that contains the project files that are developed for the learning and practice of Python.

### :computer: Technology Used
***
* files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version `1.7.*`)
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
