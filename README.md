# :rocket: Higher Level Programming

Repository that contains the project files that are developed for the learning and practice of Python and MySQL.

### :computer: Technology Used
***
#### Python :snake:
* files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version `1.7.*`)
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

#### MySQL :card_file_box:
* Files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `MySQL 8.0` (version 8.0.25)
* SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
* Files should start by a comment describing the task
* All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE`â€¦)
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
