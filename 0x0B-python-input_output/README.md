# Project 0x0B. Python - Input/Output 📚

### Requirements
***
#### Python Scripts
* Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

#### Python Test Cases
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`

### 🎨 Style
***
* Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*).
